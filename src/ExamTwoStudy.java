    //DATA STORAGE
    /* 1.) HashMaps data structure store a lot of data and can retrieve them quickly (social media website data).
     * 2.) Linked list data structures are good for navigating forward and backward (search history data).
     * 3.) Stacks could be used to pull previous commands (computer terminal in JES (FIFO)).
     * 4.) Queue could be used for messaging applications (messenger (FILO))

    //DATA STRUCTURE & ACCESSED DATA
    /* 1.) The need to store frequently accessed data into a system (search engine): HashMap or LinkedList
     * 2.) Stack data structure could implement undo-redo.
     * 3.) You need to store information about the routes and connections between various cities: HashMap, due to keywords.
     * 4.) You need to store a music streaming app: LinkedList
     *   --LinkedLists differ from ArrayLists because you can implement data in the middle
     * 5.) You need to create a back button: Stack
     * 6.) You need to implement a digital shopping cart: LinkedList
     *   --Gives the ability to remove from the middle.
