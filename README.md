  Ultimately, my goal as a student a future worker is to become familiar with an array of technology in order to further my efforts of being a well-rounded artist. The artistic expression takes many forms and through interacting with all of it's facets, one may embellish the art they're more familiar with. In these activities, labs, projects and goals in mind, I hope to sharpen myself and become not only more articulate in the creative process, but be able to support myself in a world of ever-growing technology. :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
